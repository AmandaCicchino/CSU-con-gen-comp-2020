CSU FWCB/BZ 5XX Instructors: Eric C. Anderson and Kristen C. Ruegg Site Last Updated: 2019-12-03 Course Overview Welcome to the course web page for Advanced Computing and Bioinformatics for Conservation Genomics, an experimental course being offered for the first time in Winter Semester 2020. The proposed course topics appear, by week, in the table below. Each week of the course is structured as a different chapter in the navigation panel on the left. In order to figure out what we are doing in the course each week, that will be the first place to check. The week’s objectives, readings, and exercises will be listed there. Course Learning Objectives Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to: Organize and execute a complex bioinformatic data-analysis project in a manner that makes it easily understood and reproduced by others. Describe the main data formats used in genomic analysis, and know how to generate and manipulate them. Work with a wide range of the bioinformatic tools available in the Unix environment and understand how to script these tools into pipelines for DNA sequence alignment, variant calling, and analysis. Understand how to break down complex genomic analysis projects into small, independent chunks and execute those using job arrays on a high performance computing cluster. Perform a variety of computational analyses central to conservation genetics. Assessment Assessment will be based mostly on weekly problem sets. These will sometimes require considerable time and thought, but they will be critical for solidifying the concepts and procedures in the course. Students will also be undertaking individual projects in which they apply the skills they have learned in the course to a data set relevant in some way to their own research (see below). Finally, students are expected to contribute to discussion and participation in the course, including (and most importantly) being helpful to one another in order to learn challenging material, together, in a supportive environment. “It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -–- Napolean Hill Assessment Component Percentage of Grade Problem sets 60% Individual analysis projects 30% Class participation 10% Weekly Schedule The schedule is subject to change as the semester proceeds, but this is what we are shooting for.

Not to mention the fact that R is not typically central to hard-core bioinformatic tasks in a Unix environment. However, bear with us. Using RStudio sets you up with a great mechanism for recording your work in RMarkdown Notebooks, it provides a natural way to organize projects, it makes it trivial to keep your work version-controlled, and finally, when you have done all your bioinformatics, it is great for analysis of and figure preparation from the generated data in the R language.
