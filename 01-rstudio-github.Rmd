# Getting setup with Rstudio and GitHub

It might seem strange to start a bioinformatics course with a segment
on RStudio, since most bioinformatics takes place on large computer
clusters which can't always be configured by individual users to
play well with RStudio running on a server.  Not to mention the fact that
R is not typically central to hard-core bioinformatic tasks in a 
Unix environment.  However, bear with us.  Using RStudio sets you up
with a great mechanism for recording your work in RMarkdown Notebooks,
it provides a natural way to organize projects, it makes it trivial
to keep your work version-controlled, and finally, when you have done
all your bioinformatics, it is great for analysis of and figure preparation from
the generated data in the R language.
