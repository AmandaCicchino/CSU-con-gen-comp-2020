# Course Overview {-}

Welcome to the course web page for Advanced Computing and Bioinformatics for Conservation Genomics,
an experimental course being offered for the first time in Winter Semester 2020.  The proposed course
topics appear, by week, in the table below.  Each week of the course is structured as a different
chapter in the navigation panel on the left.  In order to figure out what we are doing in the course
each week, that will be the first place to check.  The week's objectives, readings, and exercises will
be listed there.

## Course Learning Objectives {-}

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1.	Organize and execute a complex bioinformatic data-analysis project in a manner that makes it easily understood and reproduced by others.
2.	Describe the main data formats used in genomic analysis, and know how to generate and manipulate them. 
3.	Work with a wide range of the bioinformatic tools available in the Unix environment and understand how to script these tools into pipelines for DNA sequence alignment, variant calling, and analysis.
4.	Understand how to break down complex genomic analysis projects into small, independent chunks and execute those using job arrays on a high performance computing cluster.
5.	Perform a variety of computational analyses central to conservation genetics.


## Assessment {-}

Assessment will be based mostly on weekly problem sets.  These will sometimes require
considerable time and thought, but they will be critical for solidifying the concepts
and procedures in the course. Students will also be undertaking individual projects
in which they apply the skills they have learned in the course to a data set
relevant in some way to their own research (see [below](#indproj)).
Finally, students are expected to contribute to discussion and participation in the course,
including (and most importantly) being helpful to one another in order to learn challenging material,
together, in a supportive environment.
